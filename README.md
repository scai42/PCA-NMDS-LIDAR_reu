# PCA_remnant-restored-wetlands
NSF-funded REU at Oregon State CEOAS using principal component analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling 

![Salmon Marsh, Willamette Valley, OR USA](https://github.com/salmon-marsh.png)
Used variant data collected over several decades on re
stored/remnant prairie wetlands, including recent LiDAR depth-imaging.
